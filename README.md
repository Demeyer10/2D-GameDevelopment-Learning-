# 2D-GameDevelopment-Learning-

## My Goal
To learn the concepts of building a 2D game. This will help me get a better understand of the JAVA language while being able to build something cool in the process. I have a ton of ideas for games just never knew exactly how they are made using a programming language. My hope is by the end of my 2D game development journey, I will be able to build my own fully working game.
